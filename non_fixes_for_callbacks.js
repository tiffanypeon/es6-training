// rather than having a single callback, also use an error callback (to avoid error swallowing)
// single callback - error first callbacks. reserve first param of every error signature so if it's set
// we'll assume error and if not we assume success
// every callback has an if/else

// what if one has an error and a success, or neither, or the callback is called multiple times? 

// Running Example: 
// "The Meaning of Life"
//
